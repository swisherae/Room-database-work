# Room-database-work
Aden Swisher
This is an app for creating a profile and signing in through a room database.  The basis for the app is that it is a check in app for a local gym called "Monsters Ballroom" so all resources were either taken from the website and replicated through the app or created for the project.

Tech used: XML, Kotlin, Android Studio

Main goal of the app: This project was used to get familiar working with room databases and transferring outside resources such as fonts and images.
